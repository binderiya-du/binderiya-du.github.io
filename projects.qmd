## **Project Overview**

This project analyzes the real estate market in **Far Rockaway**, New York, to determine investment opportunities and market trends. By examining historical data and forecasting future sales, we explore which property segments offer the best potential for growth.

## **Data Analysis**

We began with a dataset containing real estate transactions in **Far Rockaway**, which included 8,781 rows of data. After filtering for residential properties, we were left with 8,113 rows of relevant data. Key findings include:

- The most frequent sale price range is between **$250,000 and $500,000**.
- **Market trends** show a significant dip in sales after the **2008 recession**, with a slow recovery post-2016.

## **Clustering and Market Segments**

Using clustering analysis, we identified five distinct property segments in Far Rockaway:

1. **Cluster 1**: Average-sized, newer properties with below-average sale prices.
2. **Cluster 2**: Newer, moderately sized properties with above-average sale prices.
3. **Cluster 3**: Smaller, older homes with average sale prices.
4. **Cluster 4**: Larger, high-value luxury homes or large commercial properties.
5. **Cluster 5**: Smaller, older homes with lower prices.

These clusters help identify which property types are expected to perform well in the future, particularly for young professionals seeking modern housing.

## **Sales Forecasting**

We performed a **sales trajectory forecasting** analysis, which revealed that **newer properties** are more likely to benefit from the current recovery, driven by infrastructure improvements and increased interest from younger professionals.

- **Projected growth** in sales is expected in neighborhoods with modern properties, with the demand for these properties expected to rise.

## **Investment Recommendations**

Based on the analysis and clustering results, we recommend investing in **newer properties** in Far Rockaway, particularly those with an optimal size of around **3,000 sq ft**. Key reasons for this recommendation include:

- **High tenant appeal** due to modern designs and reduced vacancy rates.
- **Lower maintenance costs** for newer properties.
- **Strong market performance**, with newer properties showing higher sales than older real estate.

## **Conclusion**

In conclusion, the analysis of Far Rockawayâ€™s real estate market reveals strong investment potential, particularly in newer properties. These properties offer a balance of **high returns** with **lower risk**, especially with the expected growth in sales driven by urban developments and infrastructure projects. This project demonstrates how data can inform strategic decisions in the real estate market.
